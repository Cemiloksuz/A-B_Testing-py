Description

A business recently added a new way to bid called "average bidding" to go along with the current "maximumbidding" method. Bombabomba.com, one of our clients, wants to see if this new feature works better with average bidding than with maximum bidding. They plan to do an A/B test to find out. One month has passed since the start of the A/B test, and now bombabomba.com wants you to look over the results. "Purchase" is the best way to tell if Bombabomba.com is doing well. So, the "Purchase" measure should be the main focus of statistical tests.

Data sets with information from a company's website were used in this project. There is information in the data about things like how many ads people saw and clicked on, as well as how much money these ads brought in. The Control group and the Test group are two different sets of data. For the Control group, the Maximum Bidding method was used, and for the Test group, the Average Bidding method was used.
